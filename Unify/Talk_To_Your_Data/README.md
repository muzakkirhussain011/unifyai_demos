### 🧐 Overview  
**Chat with Your CSV Data** is a web application built with Streamlit that enables users to interact with their CSV datasets through **natural language queries**. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), users can extract insights, visualizations, and analyses from their data without needing to write code!  

---

### 🎯 Objective  
The main goal of this app is to provide an intuitive and interactive way for users to analyze and visualize their data using **conversational AI**. It demonstrates how AI can simplify data science and help everyone, regardless of their technical skills, explore data effectively.  

---

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Streamlit**: 🌐 For building the easy-to-use web interface.  
- **Unify AI**: 🤖 Powers the backend LLMs that respond to your queries in real-time.
